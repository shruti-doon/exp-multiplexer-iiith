1. Firstly learn everything from the 'Demo' section.
2. Then, test your understanding about multiplexer circuits in the 'Pretest' section.
3. Then in the 'Practice' section in the task-1 "2 X 1 MUX", make a 2-bit multiplexer circuit using logic gates and test it with different inputs.
4. Then, in the task-2 "4 X 1 MUX", implement a 4-bit multiplexer circuit using 2 X 1 multiplexer and test it with different inputs.
5. After that, test your understanding of the experiment in the 'Posttest' section.
